# predict_author_h-index
The goal of this challenge is to study and apply machine learning / artificial intelligence methods to a real-world regression problem. In this problem, each data corresponds to an author and we are asked to predict the h-index of this author. The h-index of an author measures its productivity and its impact in the research field. It is defined as the maximum value h such that the author has published h paper(s) that have each been cited at least h times. To build the model, we have:

- a graph that shapes the intensity of collaboration between researchers
- extracts from authors' papers

For this project, I needed to trained my own word2vec neural network. it is to heavy to be placed here.
